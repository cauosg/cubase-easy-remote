# CubaseControl

## 📌 Introduction
**CubaseControl** is an open-source project being prepared for public release, targeting homecast users. It remotely controls only the essential functions of **Cubase (LE)** to make it easier to use.

Cubase is designed for professional audio engineers, making it difficult for non-experts to navigate its interface and features. **CubaseControl** simplifies the user experience by exposing only the minimum required functions in the UI, allowing users to operate their Decks effortlessly.

Additionally, it provides a **basic project template** consisting of built-in and open plugins that are compatible with the LE version. This helps users start broadcasting smoothly without needing prior knowledge of plugins.

Future updates, including additional templates and feature improvements, will be managed through pull requests.
